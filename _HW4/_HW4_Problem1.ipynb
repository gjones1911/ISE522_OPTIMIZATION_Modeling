    "## Problem Description:\n",
    "> A company supplies goods to <b>three customers</b>, who <b>each demand 30 units</b>. The company has <b>two warehouses</b>. <b>Warehouse 1 has 40 units</b> on hand and <b>Warehouse 2 has 30</b>. The <b>costs of shipping 1 unit from warehouse to a given customer are shown in the table displayed below in the [Data Display section](#Data-Display) </b>. There is a <b>penalty for unmet demand</b> that is <b>specific to each customer</b> and these are also displayed in the [Data Display section](#Data-Display). The task is to formulate this blanced transportation problem to <b>minimize the sum of the shortage and shipping costs</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes and Observations\n",
    "* total supply across all locataion is less than total demand\n",
    "* confilcting objectives:\n",
    "    * increasing supply increases cost\n",
    "    * not supplying what is demanded increases cost\n",
    "* means need just the right amounts supplied from each warehouse to customer to get optimal solution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions:\n",
    "* units are integer values i.e. the smallest value of units above zero is 1\n",
    "* Customers can be supplied by multiple warehouses to meet demands"

    "> ### The solution....\n",
    "> The problem requires that a decision be made about how much each warehouse will supply to which customer. Looking at the unmet demand penalties the general idea should be to supply the customers with the higher penalties more than those with lower penalties to minimize unmet demand cost. From the supply costs from each warehouse to each customer the warehouse 1 has lower supply costs overall compared to warehouse 2 for any given customer.  Since warehouse 1 has more supply, I would expect that it supplies most of the demand with warehouse 2 picking up the slack. For both warehouses the magnitude of demand in ascending order is customers 1, 2, and 3. Since customer 1 has a lower cost for warehouse 2 I would try to send most of the supply for that customer from warehouse 2. This would mean that warehouse 1 would need to cover most of the demands for customers 2, and 3. Customers 1 and 3 have higher unmet demand penalties than customer 2 so I would allow for more unmet demand to this customer. I would supply what I had left over in warehouse 1 to customer 2 to met what demand I could.  I would supply as close to what customer 3 demanded as possible since it has the highest unmet demand cost. This ad hoc solution is like what is seen in the solution produced by Gurobi. \n",
