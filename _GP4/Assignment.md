For this assignment I would like to do a literature review of methods for solving multi-item lot sizing problems.

Please answer the following questions:

1. Write a one-page summary of the different types of multi-item lot sizing problems (MILSP) that have been studied.

2. Has anyone studied the MILSP with a minimum order quantity?

3. Has anyone studied the MILSP with a minimum inventory levels?

4. Has anyone studied the MILSP with an all-units quantity discount?

5. Has anyone studied the MILSP in which inventory is stored at two locations (i.e., the supplier and warehouse)? Are there any papers that study a similar problem?

6. Has anyone studied the same problem that we studied in the group assignment? Have they studied problems that are similar?

To answer questions 2-6, you will probably need to do a literature review . I expect you to cite at least one paper for each of questions 2-6.
