For this assignment I would like to do a literature review to understand methods for solving problems that are related to the problem you solved in individual assignment 4. Please answer the following questions:

1.Read through the following survey: (Single-item dynamic lot-sizing problems: An updated survey)[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221717304368] (Links to an external site.). Classify our problem (the one solved in individual assignment 4) according to the Classification provided in Table 1 of the paper (also see Section 4).

2. Describe at least one well-known and popular method for the classic single-item dynamic lot sizing problem (SILSP).

3. Describe at least one state-of-the-art method for solving the SILSIP with a minimum inventory amount.

4. Describe at least one state-of-the-art method for solving the SILSIP with minimum order quantities.

5. Describe at least one state-of-the-art method for solving the SILSIP with quantity discounts. (Note: our problem has an "all units" quantity discount.)

6. Has anyone studied the SILSP in which inventory is stored at two locations (i.e., the supplier and warehouse)? Are there any papers that study a similar problem?

7. Has anyone studied the same problem that we studied in individual assignment 4 (i.e., including inventory held at the supplier)? Have they studied problems that are similar?

To answer questions 2-7, you will probably need to do a literature review . I expect you to cite at least one paper for each of questions 2-7.
