    "> We consider inventory management decisions when manufacturing and warehousing are controlled by independent entities. The latter possess private information that affects their choices and are allowed to communicate via a mediator who attempts to streamline their decisions without restricting their freedom. The mediator designs a mechanism based on quantity discounts to minimize the overall system costs, attempting to reach a win–win situation for both entities. Using the Revelation Principle, we show that it is in the entities’ self-interest to reveal their information and we prove that coordination is attainable even under bilateral information asymmetry. The acceptable cost allocation is not unique, providing adequate flexibility to the mediator during mechanism design; the flexibility may reflect the relative power of the entities and is quantified in our work by a series of computational experiments. Our approach is motivated by inventory management practices in a manufacturing group and, thus, it is directly applicable to real-life cases.\n",

    "> ### Abstract:\n",
    "Good inventory management is essential for a firm to be cost competitive and to acquire decent profit in the market, and how to achieve an outstanding inventory management has been a popular topic in both the academic field and in real practice for decades. As the production environment getting increasingly complex, various kinds of mathematical models have been developed, such as linear programming, nonlinear programming, mixed integer programming, geometric programming, gradient-based nonlinear programming and dynamic programming, to name a few. However, when the problem becomes NP-hard, heuristics tools may be necessary to solve the problem. In this paper, a mixed integer programming (MIP) model is constructed first to solve the lot-sizing problem with multiple suppliers, multiple periods and quantity discounts. An efficient Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed next to tackle the problem when it becomes too complicated. The objectives are to minimize total costs, where the costs include ordering cost, holding cost, purchase cost and transportation cost, under the requirement that no inventory shortage is allowed in the system, and to determine an appropriate inventory level for each planning period. The results demonstrate that the proposed GA model is an effective and accurate tool for determining the replenishment for a manufacturer for multi-periods.\n",

In this problem, the inventory deteriorates over time, depending on the warehouse conditions, so multiple warehouses with different technologies are considered in this study. Each warehouse has a specified deterioration rate and holding cost. The purpose of the SILSP-MW is to determine production periods and quantities and to select the appropriate warehouse to hold the inventory in each period, such that specified demand in each period is being satisfied while the total cost is minimized. We shall present a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation to model the problem. Moreover, a Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm will be presented to solve this problem.

The objective is to satisfy the requirements in the production plan with minimum transportation and inventory holding costs over a multi-period planning horizon. Transportation costs are charged to the manufacturer on a per truck shipment basis. We **investigate the option of delaying a less-than-full truckload shipment to the next period**, by **utilizing the safety stocks as needed**. We **analyze the impact of delaying shipments on both cost and service levels in stochastic environments through experiments with data from a bus manufacturer**. The results indicate that the proposed policy reduces both holding and transportation costs without creating much stock-out risk.\n",

    "    - > Depending on the amounts to be shipped and the truck capacity, less-than-full truckloads may arise frequently, while the full truck cost must be paid. To increase the truckload percentages, we consider delaying transportation of a portion of the order to the next period. That is, instead of shipping the required number of trucks whenever an order is given in a period, we allow delaying the shipment of items that would cause a small truckload to the next period, and keep them at the supplier. To ensure that the production plan is not disrupted by the delaying, the delayed amounts are limited by the safety stock levels so that the safety stock compensates for the delayed items. The proposed policy is viable when shipments take a short time. The manufacturer and its supplier are in close proximity to each other in the bus manufacturer case mentioned above. For this reason, we assume that the transportation lead time is zero in our models. When the manufacturer places an order, the supplier can send the required items within the same day because of the short distance and its make-to-stock strategy.\n",

    "    Vendor-managed inventory is a coordinated system where a vendor decides about the retailer's replenishment quantity and time. This work studies a two-echelon distribution work composed of multiple vendors and retailers in traditional and vendor-managed inventory systems where unsatisfied demands are lost sales. We also consider that the retailers' demand is stochastic following a uniform distribution. The mathematical models are developed and applied in vendor-managed inventory and traditional systems. Under the traditional supply chain, the vendor incurs the cost of holding and production setup, while a retailer incurs expenses for inventory holding, ordering, transportation and lost sales. In a vendor-managed inventory system, as the vendor is responsible for his retailers, the retailer's costs are transferred to the vendor. We aim to identify benefits of vendor-managed inventory. The total cost per unit time is used as a comparable measure between vendor-managed inventory and traditional systems. Numerical examples and a sensitivity analysis of key parameters include the vendor's setup cost and holding cost; the retailer's transportation and ordering costs are presented in both vendor-managed inventory and traditional systems. The results illustrate that vendor-managed inventory total system inventory cost is lower than a traditional system where shortage is allowed.\n",

    "* [Review of GA applications in lot sizing](https://link-springer-com.utk.idm.oclc.org/article/10.1007/s10845-008-0205-2)\n",
    "> Lot sizing problems are production planning problems with the objective of determining the periods where production should take place and the quantities to be produced in order to satisfy demand while minimizing production, setup and inventory costs. Most lot sizing problems are combinatorial and hard to solve. In recent years, to deal with the complexity and find optimal or near-optimal results in reasonable computational time, a growing number of researchers have employed meta-heuristic approaches to lot sizing problems. One of the most popular meta-heuristics is genetic algorithms which have been applied to different optimization problems with good results. The focus of this paper is on the recent published literature employing genetic algorithms to solve lot sizing problems. The aim of the review is twofold. First it provides an overview of recent advances in the field in order to highlight the many ways GAs can be applied to various lot sizing models. Second, it presents ideas for future research by identifying gaps in the current literature. In reviewing the relevant literature the focus has been on the main features of the lot sizing problems and the specifications of genetic algorithms suggested in solving these problems. \n",
