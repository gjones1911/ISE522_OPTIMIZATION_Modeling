    "1. Solve the classic single-item lot sizing problem (with fixed setup costs for orders; a slightly simpler\n",
    "   version of the problem you solved in individual assignment 2) by modeling it as a **shortest path** problem\n",

    "2. Based on what you found in your literature review in assignment IA-5, recommend a method (apart from\n",

From the demands and amounts ordered there are left over stock held of 30, 20, 10 for weeks 1, 2, and 3 respectively and amounts of 40, and 20 for weeks 7 and 8.
