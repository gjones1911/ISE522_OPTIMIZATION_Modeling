    "1. Solve the classic single-item lot sizing problem (with fixed setup costs for orders; a slightly simpler\n",
    "   version of the problem you solved in individual assignment 2) by modeling it as a **shortest path** problem\n",
    "   and solving it using a solver of your choice. The dataset for this problem is attached.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Based on what you found in your literature review in assignment IA-5, recommend a method (apart from\n",
    "   modeling it as a mixed-integer program) for solving the problem you solved in IA-4. (You do not need to\n",

This ordering strategy leads to **ordering costs at weeks 1 and 7 of 100 each for total ordering costs of 200**. From the demands and amounts ordered there are left over stock held of 30, 20, 10 for weeks 1, 2, and 3 respectively and amounts of 40, and 20 for weeks 7 and 8. The leads to **total held over stock cost of 240** thus, a **total cost of 200 + 240 or 440** is incured during the ten week period according to the optimal solution.  "

    "> From our literature review we found the algorithm purposed by Fredrgruen and Lee (1990) that looked at both incremental and all-unit discounts. Their solution can uses a dynamic programing algortihm with complextiy of O(T$^2$) for the all-unit discounts version, where T is the number of periods. For the problem for IP4 the value of T is 10. There method uses a piecwise function to control when the cost is at the discounted rate as seen in the \"cost-constraint\" expression seen below. The goal is to minimize the cost function which is seen in the expression labeled \"objective\".  "
