For this assignment I want you to apply a decomposition technique to solve the full problem that you 
tried to solve in assignment 3b (use the same problem description and data). Specifically, I would 
like you to obtain a Lagrangian relaxation lower bound for a particular multiplier vector. You should
start with a multiplier vector of all zeros and solve the relaxed problem to obtain an upper bound on
the original problem. Then increase it to all tens and see if the upper bound improves.
