    "## Problem Description:\n",
    "> The farmer's problem Consider and farmer in east Tennessee who specializes in raising wheat, corn, and sugar beets on her 500 acres of land. During the winter, she wants to decide how much land to devote to each crop. The farmer knows that at least 200 tons (T) of wheat and 240 T of corn are needed for cattle feed. These amounts can be raised on the farm or bought from a wholesaler. Any production in excess of the feeding requirement would be sold. Over the last decade, mean selling prices have been $\\text{\\$170}$ and $\\text{\\$150}$ per ton of wheat and corn, respectively. The purchase prices are 40% more than this due to the wholesaler's margin and transportation costs.\n",
    "<br><p>\n",
    "> Another profitable crop is **sugar beet**, which he expects to sell at $\\text{\\$36}$/T; however, the EU imposes a quota on sugar beet production. Any amount in excess of the quota can be sold onlv at $\\text{\\$10}$/T. The farmer'squota for next year is 6,000 T. Based on past experience, the farmer knows that he mean yield on his land is roughly 2.5 T,3 T, and 20 T per acre for wheat, corn, and sugar beets, respectively. The table on the next slide summarizes these data and provides the planting costs for these crops. Formulate a linear program to maximize total profit (planting cost â€”revenue from sales).</p>\n",

    "# Extentions To Accomplish:\n",

    "   average, each with equation probability. What is the expected annual profit?](#prob1)\n",
    "    - [Problem 1 Method Defintion and Execution Cell](#prob1-meth)\n",
    "2. [Consider an extension of the problem in which prices also are uncertain. Specifically, when yields are above \n",
    "   average prices for corn and wheat go down by 10% and when yields are below average, they go up by 10%.\n",

    "3. Consider a different version of the problem in which the farmer possesses four fields of sizes 185, 145, 105, and \n",
    "   65, respectively. The total of 500 acres is unchanged. However, the farmer wishes to only plant one type of crop \n",

    "The above code cell defines a function that calculates the expected profit when hedging on the three possible yield scenerios. The following sections will describe the three stages of the process and the resulting expected profit. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Stage 1: Deciding how much to plant\n",
    "> For stage one the amounts to plant are given in the problem and are;\n",
    "> *       wheat = 120 \n",
    "> *        corn = 80\n",
    "> * sugar beets = 300\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attempting to Quantify Uncertainty into 3 scenerios:\n",
    "> From the problem describe in class there are three possible scenerios of yields rates (acres/ton) that are considered. \n",
    "> 1. The yield amount is below average i.e. 20% less than average \n",
    "> 2. The yield amount is average i.e. what is found in the provided data table\n",
    "> 3. The yield amount is above average i.e. 20% more than average\n",
    "> Using the yield rates of 80% for below average, 100% for average, and 120% for above average each expected yield is increased by the corresponding yield case (below average, average, above average) to produce the expected yields seen in the above output labled, \"Wheat yields\", \"Corn yields\", \"Sugar Beets yields\" each with the corresponding yield case. These amounts can been seen in the above cells output under the \"**Expected Yields (tons) for Each Possible Case**\" section detailing the amount of tons of each crop is expected for each case. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Stage 2: How much needs to be purchased and sold \n",
    "> The amount that needs to be purchased is the difference between the amounts of feed crops we have based on expected yield and the minimum amounts needed for feed crops. If the amount of feed crops (wheat/corn) yielded is below the minimum amount required for feed then the difference must be purchased (see \"Expected Crops That need to be purchased for each case\" section). If for a given scenerio the amount of feed crops are above the minimum amount the difference can be sold for a profit(see \"Expected Excess Crops for each case\" section). For each crop there is a set purchasing price and for each of the feed crops there is a set selling price. However, for the sugar beets there is a two level system of selling prices. If the amount of sugar beets yielded is above the set quota of 6kT then there is a higher sale price for each ton below this quota. Every ton above the quota must be sold at a lower selling price. If the amount sold is at or below the quota then only the higher price need be considered. If the amount of sugar beets yielded is in excess of the quota the difference between the quota and the amount of sugar beets yielded must be sold at the lower selling price. Thus the amount that needs to be sold in each scenerio is based on how much excess wheat, and corn we have, and the amount of sugar beets we have. The amount to be purhased is the difference between the minimum wheat and corn amounts and what is yielded in a given scenerio and only matters when there are less crops yielded than the minimum. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculating the Expected Yield:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Profit\n",
    "> To calculate the expected profit with the uncertainties you must calculate the expected profit in each of the scenerios and sum these expected profits weighted by their probability of occurance. For each scenerio the objective is:<br>\n",
    "> <center>-planting_costs - purchasing_cost + sales_profits = gross_profit</center>\n",
    "> This Calculation must be performed for each yield scenerio. To accomplish this the method uses a set of matrices where the rows represent one of the crops and the columns represent one of the scenerios for the sales profits, and purchasing costs operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Planting Costs:\n",
    "> The above defined and called method calcultes the planting costs for each crop and sums them to get the total planting costs displayed in the above output under the \"Planting Costs for Given Crop Allotments\" section of the output. These costs are constant across the scenerios because it is assumed that the given allotsments are used for each with differing yield conditions. \n",

    "### Sales Profits & Purchasing Costs:\n",
    "#### Sales Profits:\n",
    "> To calculate the sales profits two calculations are performed. First the amount of excess of each crop is calculated and the profit from the sale of this amount is calculated. For the sugar beets any amount of yield is considred excess and thus will be sold, but the amount it sells for is dependent on the yield for the scenerio. If the yeild is above the quota then the first 6K tons will be sold for the higher 36 ($\\text{\\$}$/T) rate, and the remaining will be sold at the lower 10 ($\\text{\\$}$/T) rates. For this step two arrays are kept. One represents the amount in each scenerio that is within the quota. If the yield for sugar beets does not exceed the quota then it is just this amount, if the yielded is above the quota then this value is set to the quota, and the excess is calculated and stored in the second array that holds the amount over the quota for a given scenerio. In a similar manner the amount in excess for the feed crops and the amount lacking and thus needing to be purchased based on the minimum are also kept as arrays. These arrays can be seen in the ouput labled missing_wheat, missing_corn, and justright_sugarbeets, for the arrays for the below, average, and above average cases for the amounts in each that are lacking in the feed crops and or that is below the quota for the sugar beets. The outputs labeled excess_wheat, excess_corn, and excess_sugarbeets are arrays of similar form for the amounts of extra wheat, and corn above the feed crop minimum is available for each scenerio and the amount of sugar beets over the quota repsectively. To calculate the sales profits in each scenerio the sales price for each crop type is multiplied by the excess crop arrays and the justright_sugarbeets arrays with the appropriate sales prices based on the table. This produces three arrays representing the below average, average, and above average cases for each of the three crops as seen in the \"Sales profits\" section of the output. At the end of the section an array labeled total sales profits is displayed that represents the total sales profits for each scenerio which is just the column wise summation of the three sales profits array for the crops. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purchasing Costs:\n",
    "> To calculate the purchasing costs the missing_wheat, and missing_corn arrays are multiplied by the purchasing costs for the corresponding crops. The results of this calculation can be seen in the output labeled \"Purchase Costs\". \n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Profits with Uncertainty Solution:\n",
    "> To calculate the expected profit based on all three scenerios and the given acreage assignments each scenerios planting, purchasing costs are summed with the sales profits, then each scenerios profits are multiplied by the probability and these\n",
    "values are summed. The results of thes operations can be seen in the output labled \"Expected Profit\". From the calculation the hedged allotments would lead to an **expected profit of 107240.0.**"
