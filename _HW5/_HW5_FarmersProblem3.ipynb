    "## Problem Description:\n",
    "> The farmer's problem Consider and farmer in east Tennessee who specializes in raising wheat, corn, and sugar beets on her 500 acres of land. During the winter, she wants to decide how much land to devote to each crop. The farmer knows that at least 200 tons (T) of wheat and 240 T of corn are needed for cattle feed. These amounts can be raised on the farm or bought from a wholesaler. Any production in excess of the feeding requirement would be sold. Over the last decade, mean selling prices have been $\\text{\\$170}$ and $\\text{\\$150}$ per ton of wheat and corn, respectively. The purchase prices are 40% more than this due to the wholesaler's margin and transportation costs.\n",
    "<br><p>\n",
    "> Another profitable crop is **sugar beet**, which he expects to sell at $\\text{\\$36}$/T; however, the EU imposes a quota on sugar beet production. Any amount in excess of the quota can be sold onlv at $\\text{\\$10}$/T. The farmer'squota for next year is 6,000 T. Based on past experience, the farmer knows that he mean yield on his land is roughly 2.5 T,3 T, and 20 T per acre for wheat, corn, and sugar beets, respectively. The table on the next slide summarizes these data and provides the planting costs for these crops. Formulate a linear program to maximize total profit (planting cost â€”revenue from sales).</p>\n",

    "# Extentions To Accomplish:\n",
    "1. [Suppose the farmer allocates 120 acres to wheat, 80 to corn, and 300 for sugar beets. But also suppose that the \n",

    "   average, each with equation probability. What is the expected annual profit?](#prob1)\n",
    "    - [Problem 1 Method Defintion and Execution Cell](#prob1-meth)\n",
    "2. [Consider an extension of the problem in which prices also are uncertain. Specifically, when yields are above \n",
    "   average prices for corn and wheat go down by 10% and when yields are below average, they go up by 10%.\n",
    "   Assume sugar beet prices are not affected by yields. Formulate and solve a stochastic linear program and solve \n",
    "   it with a solver.](#prob2)\n",
    "3. [Consider a different version of the problem in which the farmer possesses four fields of sizes 185, 145, 105, and \n",
    "   65, respectively. The total of 500 acres is unchanged. However, the farmer wishes to only plant one type of crop \n",
