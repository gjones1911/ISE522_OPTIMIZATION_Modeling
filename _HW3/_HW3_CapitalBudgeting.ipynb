    "> * Suppose you are an investor, and you are considering investing in <span style=\"color:red\"><b>three projects</b></span>.\n",
    "> * It is possible to invest in a fractional amount of a project or the entire amount. For example, if we invest in 0.5 on project 3, then we have cash outflows of -$\\$1$ million at time 0 and 0.5.) If you fully invest in a project, the realized cash flows, (in millions of dollars) will be as shown in the following Table.\n",
