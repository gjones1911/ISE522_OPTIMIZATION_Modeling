    "> ## The solution suggest to produce 6K and 4K units of products 1 and 3 repsectively at plant 1, and 8K and 1K units of products 2 and 3 respectively at plant 2. The solution shows that you should produce the products where their costs are lower. The costs of producing products 1 and 3 are cheaper at plant 1, but since each plant can only produce 10K units each and there must be at least 5k units of product 3 produced the last unit is produced at plant 2. Since the cost of producing product 2 at plant 2 is lower than at plant 1 it makes sense to make all of the required 8k units at plant 2.  This solution leads to an optimal cost of 128K.  "

    "### Question 1:\n",
    "* What would the cost of producing product 2 at plant 1 have to be for Gepbab to start producing there?\n",
    "    - **Answer:** The reduced cost for producing product 2 at plant 1 (Xsc[0,1]) is 1. From this the **price would need to be reduced by 1, i.e. 6-1 = 5** so that this option will be see a positive coefficient in the solution. \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2: \n",
    "* What would the total cost be if plant 1 had 9k units of capacity?\n",
    "    - **Answer:** The shadow price of the capacity constraint for plant one is -2 indicating that increasing the capacity by one unit would decrease the cost by two. From this it seems that decreasing the capacity by 1 from 10K to 9k would increase the cost by 2 from 128K to 130K  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3: \n",
    "* If it cost \\$9 to produce a unit of product 3 at plant 1, then what would be the new optimal solution\n",
    "    - **Answer:** The reduced cost for producing product 3 at plant 1 (Xsc[0,2]) is 0 with an objective coefficient range from 9 to 7. This means that increasing it up to 9 will not change the solution so the solution would be the same.  "
