Continuing your work from assignment 5, I would like you to find the maximum Lagrangian lower bound by searching for 
the optimal multiplier vector. Start your search with a vector of all zeros. You should solve the same problem that 
you tried to solve in assignment 3b (use the same problem description and data).
